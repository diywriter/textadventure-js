# textadventure-js

I am working on building a text adventure game using javascript (and jquery). Leveraging a tutorial made by <a href="https://github.com/stevegwh">stevegwh</a>. Please check out his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXHPLNOp6DXvkoQMSazj8Pg">YouTube channel</a> to help achieve your coding -- erhm -- dreams? 

I am pretty new at this. If you have comments or feedback I'd appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts. 

**ChangeLog**

Version 0.3:

building on what I've learned from the tutorial by adding new-to-me concepts:
 - look functionality
 - nesting item and character objects in "rooms." 

- learning for me:
   - nested objects with multiple layers was getting a bit tricky to understand complex indenting syntax.
   
- future state plan: 
 - aiming to add the ability to randomly choose a pre-defined character phrase when using a future talk command for a bit of realism. 
 - pick up function including transferring an item from the room to the player
 - monsters and hp
 - currency and spending currency on items


Version 0.2: 

Go + navigation; text box clears after each command, help menu, inventory function begin. 


Version 0.1:

Mostly leveraged from tutorial
  *Created a rooms.js file to display rooms.
  *script.js includes movement between rooms. 
  *html / css includes rudimentary functionality for proof of concept. 

Future release plans: 
  *Plan to draw map and create rooms, descriptions that are original. 
  *Would like to add - items, monsters, and include a monetary system.
  
  I'm interested in learning how complex this would be as multiplayer (simple version of a MUD?)

I am working on learning basic troubleshooting skills and realizing basic concepts of the javascript language. Please be kind!  If you have tips, resources, suggestions, etc. please feel free to reach out!
