# textadventure-js

Text adventure game I am building upon from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXHPLNOp6DXvkoQMSazj8Pg">EZ Mode Code</a> using js and jquery. 

ChangeLog
Version 0.1:

Mostly leveraged from tutorial
  *Created a rooms.js file to display rooms.
  *script.js includes movement between rooms. 
  *html / css includes rudimentary functionality for proof of concept. 

Future release plans: 
  *Plan to draw map and create rooms, descriptions that are original. 
  *Would like to add - items, monsters, and include a monetary system.
  
  I'm interested in learning how complex this would be as multiplayer (simple version of a MUD?)

I am working on learning basic troubleshooting skills and realizing basic concepts of the javascript language. Please be kind!  If you have tips, resources, suggestions, etc. please feel free to reach out!
